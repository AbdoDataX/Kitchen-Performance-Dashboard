# 🍴 Kitchen Performance Dashboard – Power BI

## 📊 Overview
This project analyzes **kitchen performance for October 2022** using **Power BI**.  
The dashboard provides insights into:
- Daily consumption by item
- Stock quantities
- Turnover categories
- Inventory turnover and balance %
- Recommendations based on high-risk items and daily variance

---

## 🗂 Data Sources
The dataset was prepared from **two main files**:
1. **Consumption Data** → detailed daily usage of items.  
2. **Food Data** → reference information about food items, categories, and stock.  

All data was then **combined and cleaned** into a single consolidated file:  
- `Kitchen_Reports_October_2022_PowerBI.xlsx` → main dataset used for the dashboard.

Additionally:
- `Screenshot.png` → dashboard preview (for quick view without opening Power BI).

*(Note: `.pbix` file is not included — this repo focuses on dataset + dashboard preview for portfolio purposes.)*

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Download the Excel dataset (`Kitchen_Reports_October_2022_PowerBI.xlsx`).  
2. Load it into **Power BI Desktop**.  
3. Build visuals or connect to the data model as needed.  
4. Explore the dashboard to analyze performance and trends.

## 📌 Insights
- **High-Risk Items**: Goat Meat, Beef, Milk, and Nescafe show the highest consumption and must be closely monitored and restocked regularly.  
- **Daily Variance**: Consumption fluctuates sharply (56 vs 623 units/day). A balanced distribution plan is required to stabilize usage.
